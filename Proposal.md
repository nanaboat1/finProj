### Deliverable #1: Paragraph Project Proposal Due Wed Nov 16

# Introduction:
The topic of our Project is "RNA Localization Prediction". The objective of the project is to understand the cellular roles of RNA by predicting the sub cellilar localization. We are trying to understand if the sub cellular localization of RNA molecular can be predicted in silico from sequence information only which will give us better understanding of gene expression based on RNA sequence.

Projects like this is very helpful in stem cell research where we can predict/genetic engineer stem cells based on RNA information. For eg: We have chicken eggs and when we isolate RNA sequence we could predict how much of that will localize in muscles to make sure that we get a chicken with most meat. This could also be used in finding cure for genetic diseases like Down's syndrome, or heart diseases based on RNA information. 

# Plan of attack:
We will be going through 2 approaches. First we will use Scikit Learn(a machine learn platform) to train our model using Random Forest from RNA Locate databases where there is RNA sequences and given information in where they localize. We will also be using bioinformatics algorithms and some Greedy algorithms to carry out the prediction for the same data and compare the efficiency of that prediction if we were to use non machine learning project.
